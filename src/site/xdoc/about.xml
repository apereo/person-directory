			<p>
				The person directory service provides an interface for retrieving user
				attributes. There are implementations of the interface which provide
				easy access to attributes in both LDAP servers and relational database
				services accessible via JDBC.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other implemenations allow multiple data sources to be used for the
				aggregation of a single set of user attributes.
			</p>
			<p>
			    All of the PersonDirectory implemenations are designed to be easily
			    configured using the <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring
			    IoC framework</a>.
		    </p>
			<p>
				This Maven generated site is targeted towards development of Person
				Directory. For documentation on the available DAO implementations and
				example configurations please view the 
				<a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/UPC/PersonDirectory">PersonDirectory</a>
				page on the JA-SIG Wiki.
